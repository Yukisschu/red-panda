Web app for data collection, prediction, emotion analysis, and topic analysis on Reddit with interactive visualisations.

The aim of Red Panda is to:

- Integrate machine learning models, including the SuiBERT prediction model, BERTopic topic clustering model, as well as emotion and engagement measurement models, to uncover patterns from evolving multi-modal data (involving images, videos, or other sensor data) in mental health-related subreddits.
    
- Create and deploy a web-based visual analytics tool that can display the summarised insights to stakeholders and collect different forms of feedback interactively.
    
- Improve machine learning models using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
    
- Generate logs to document the dynamic patterns and develop customised digital health solutions.
